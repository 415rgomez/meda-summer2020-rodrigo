  <h1>The Great Outdoors</h1>
  <p>Growing up in California Ive been very fortunate to live in a state that has many different natural elements. Forest, deserts, and coast are some of the many that can be found here. I have lived in California my whole life and have had the opportunity to explore its terrain from North to South, East to West. I have always enjoyed hiking as a way to relieve stress and be a part of nature. It has a calming effect when your out on trails plus its great way to stay fit.</p>
  <h2>Hiking For beginners</h2>
    <p>Most people would think that theres not too much you need to know when it comes to hiking. The truth is theres more to it than meets the eye. Here are a few good tips that ive picked up along the way.</p>
    <ul><li>get comfortable shoe that have good grip</li>
      <li>If possible never go hiking alone in case of emergency</li>
      <li>Make sure to paln ahead for the weather</li>
      <li>Be aware of the distance you are capable of handling</li>
      <li>Preferably chose a well traveled trail</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a beginner I would recommend choosing an area that is relativley flat. You dont want to walk uphill, reach a high elevation and burn yourself out right away. I would say be aware of any limitations you might have. Hiking is a hobby that people of all ages can partake in. You just have to start off slowly like with most things and progress with time.
