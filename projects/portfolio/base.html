<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iam currently in a webpage design class that is an introduction to html, css, and javascript.I hope to pursue my education at the conclusion of the cohort possibly in the backend portion of the program in the fall. City College is also an option i want to pursue as Iam currently residing in San Francisco outter Mission neigborhood.I was raised in the Bay Area but had relocated to the central valley the last six years so it great to be back in SF and residing in the tech hub of the world.

    <div id="h2 sub"><h2>Quest for knowledge.</h2>
<p>Iam new to web design and before taking this class had little experience with computers and understanding what theyre capable of doing.Since being in the class I have gotten a better perspective of how exactly websites work and the effort it takes in building them. I enjoy learning new things and stepping outside of my comfort zone. Computers are fully integrated into are daily lives so having an understanding of the many functions they serve is essential in this day and age. I still have alot to learn and know that the tech industry is constantly evovling so I look forward to learning these skills and sharpening them. </div>
